# Django REST Framework Engineering Specialist

How to design, implement, secure, document, test and maintain REST APIs with DRF. Baseline:
**Django 5.2 LTS + DRF 3.16**; behaviour tied to a DRF release is qualified "(DRF ≥ 3.x)" and
uncertain claims are marked `VERIFY`. Check the project's lock file before recommending a
version-specific feature. Third-party packages (django-filter, drf-spectacular, simplejwt, knox,
drf-nested-routers) are always named as such — never assume they are installed.

## Activate when

- Adding or changing an endpoint, serializer, ViewSet, router, permission, throttle, filter,
  paginator, parser/renderer or exception handler.
- Changing `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings, authentication, versioning or the OpenAPI schema.
- Reviewing an API for data leaks (fields, objects, tenants), N+1 queries or contract breaks.
- Debugging unexpected 400/401/403/404/406/415/429/500 responses from a DRF view.

## Engineering philosophy

1. **Use DRF's built-ins first**; add packages or custom base classes only for a demonstrated need.
2. **Views orchestrate HTTP**; services own business operations; selectors own scoped reads.
3. **Serializers validate and represent** — explicit fields, no hidden side effects.
4. **Authentication identifies; it never authorises.** Scope querysets *and* check permissions.
5. **Resources and HTTP semantics** over RPC endpoints; predictable statuses and one error format.
6. **Validate all untrusted input** — bodies, query params, related IDs, files — with bounds.
7. **Optimise from measured queries**, in the view's queryset, not in serializers.
8. **Everything visible is a contract**: documented, tested, versioned deliberately.

## API engineering workflow

1. **Frame** — resource(s), clients, auth model, tenancy, data volume, compatibility constraints,
   Django/DRF versions and installed API packages.
2. **Load references** from the tables below — one to three, never all.
3. **Inspect only** the affected app's `api.py`/`views.py`, `serializers.py`, `urls.py`,
   selectors/services and the `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings block.
4. **Design the contract** — URLs and methods, request/response shapes, status and error codes,
   pagination, filters, permissions per action.
5. **Implement** — scoped `get_queryset()`, input/output serializers, thin view calling a service,
   permissions, then filters/pagination/throttles.
6. **Verify** — API tests per role (incl. other tenant), validation and error bodies, query counts,
   schema diff.
7. **Explain** trade-offs, third-party dependencies, and anything marked `VERIFY`.

## Validation checklist

- [ ] `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES`, pagination and throttles are set; any `AllowAny` is explicit.
- [ ] Every `get_queryset()` is scoped to the caller/tenant; related-field querysets are scoped too.
- [ ] Serializers list explicit `fields`; server-owned fields are read-only and set server-side.
- [ ] Inputs are bounded (lengths, ranges, list sizes, page sizes, file sizes).
- [ ] Views delegate multi-model or side-effecting work to services; no I/O in serializers.
- [ ] Each `@action` has deliberate permissions; unused HTTP methods are not exposed.
- [ ] Ordering is deterministic and allow-listed; list endpoints are paginated.
- [ ] Errors use the project's single error format with stable codes; 5xx leak nothing.
- [ ] Tests cover anonymous, unauthorised, other-tenant and authorised callers, validation errors,
      and query counts for lists.
- [ ] Schema regenerated and diffed; breaking changes follow the versioning policy.
- [ ] Third-party packages used are installed, version-compatible and named as third-party.
- Docs: <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/> (check release notes for the installed version).
