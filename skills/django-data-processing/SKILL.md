# Django Data Processing Engineering Specialist

Engineering judgement for systems that move and reshape data: get it in, prove it is valid,
transform it deterministically, persist it safely, prove the result matches the source, and
recover cleanly when anything fails. Baseline: **Python 3.12+, Django 5.2 LTS, DRF 3.16,
PostgreSQL, Celery 5.x**; Django 6.0 only where qualified "(Django ≥ 6.0)"; uncertain or
version-dependent claims are marked `VERIFY:`. Every API is labelled `[stdlib]`, `[Django]`,
`[DRF]` or `[third-party: package]` — check the lock file; **never assume pandas, Polars,
Celery, a broker or a distributed architecture is needed or installed.**

## Activate when

- Building an upload/import, bulk export, scheduled ingestion, ETL/ELT pipeline or data sync.
- Parsing or generating CSV, Excel, JSON/JSONL, XML, Parquet/Avro/ORC, ZIP or PDF data.
- Designing validation, rejected-record handling, field/code mapping or transformation logic.
- Processing datasets too large for memory or a single request; designing batch/chunk/parallel work.
- Writing a Celery task or management command that processes data; tracking job progress/status.
- Reconciling source and target (payroll, payments, inventory, attendance, customers).
- Troubleshooting duplicates, missing records, stuck jobs, OOM workers, slow loads or bad data.

## Data processing engineering principles

1. **Simplest architecture that meets the requirement.** Request → management command → single
   Celery queue → multi-stage pipeline → streaming platform; each step up needs a measured reason.
2. **Inputs are untrusted.** Bound size, sniff type, parse safely (no XXE, no zip bombs), validate
   before use, and neutralise formula injection on export.
3. **Stream, never load whole.** Generators, chunked readers and keyset iteration with explicit
   memory, row, byte and runtime limits.
4. **Validate at the boundary, constrain in the database.** App validation produces actionable
   errors; DB constraints are the final guard. Decide up front: reject the dataset or isolate bad records.
5. **Transformations are pure, versioned and testable.** Mapping definitions are data with a
   version recorded on every output for lineage.
6. **Every stage is idempotent and resumable.** Natural keys, upserts, run ids and checkpoints;
   delivery is at-least-once — exactly-once is achieved only as *effectively-once* through idempotent sinks.
7. **Transactions are sized deliberately.** All-or-nothing only when small enough; otherwise
   committed batches plus a recovery story.
8. **Success ≠ correctness.** Reconcile counts, totals and keys against the source; surface exceptions.
9. **Classify failures.** Retry transient ones with backoff; quarantine permanent/data errors;
   never retry validation errors.
10. **Observable and auditable.** Correlation ids, per-job counters, structured logs, alerts on
    stuck jobs, rejection spikes and watermark lag; who ran what, with which mapping version.

## Processing workflow

1. **Understand business data and requirements** — entities, owners, consumers, correctness rules
   → `data-processing-fundamentals.md`.
2. **Identify source and destination systems** — formats, access, system of record
   → `data-ingestion-engineering.md`.
3. **Quantify volume, frequency, latency** — rows/bytes per run, peak, SLA → fundamentals (architecture selection).
4. **Define schemas and data contracts** — required fields, types, keys, error codes
   → `data-validation-and-cleansing.md`.
5. **Design ingestion and validation stages** → ingestion, file references, validation.
6. **Design transformation and mapping** → `data-transformation-and-mapping.md`.
7. **Select a persistence strategy** — staging, upsert, COPY, transaction size
   → `database-loading-and-persistence.md`.
8. **Define batching, concurrency and resource limits** → `large-dataset-processing.md`,
   `data-processing-performance.md`.
9. **Design idempotency and recovery** → `processing-reliability-and-recovery.md`,
   `django-background-processing.md`.
10. **Add reconciliation and auditability** → `data-reconciliation-engineering.md`.
11. **Implement monitoring and error reporting** → `data-processing-observability.md`.
12. **Validate correctness, reliability and performance** → `data-processing-testing.md` and the checklist below.

Inspect only the affected models, services, tasks, parsers and the relevant settings block.
Load **one to three references per task** — never all.

## Skill pairings and handoffs

This skill owns **data ingestion, validation, transformation, pipelines, imports/exports,
loading strategy, reconciliation and processing reliability**; the paired skill owns the
mechanism or general practice.

| Topic | Skill |
|---|---|
| Settings, storage API, forms, signals, management command mechanics, logging config | [django-core](../django-core/SKILL.md) |
| App boundaries, service layer, events, ADRs, whether to distribute | [django-architecture](../django-architecture/SKILL.md) |
| QuerySet, bulk-operation and transaction mechanics, constraints, migrations | [django-orm](../django-orm/SKILL.md) |
| General profiling, worker sizing, application performance | [django-performance](../django-performance/SKILL.md) |
| External API clients, Celery/broker infrastructure, webhooks, object storage transfer, generic sync | [django-integrations](../django-integrations/SKILL.md) |
| General Django security, upload hardening principles, tenancy model, secrets | [django-security-engineering](../django-security-engineering/SKILL.md) |
| Test framework mechanics, factories, mocking, task-test mechanics | [django-testing](../django-testing/SKILL.md) |
| Import/export API endpoints and serializers | [django-rest-framework](../django-rest-framework/SKILL.md) |
| Rendering/formatting downloadable reports and documents | [django-report-generation](../django-report-generation/SKILL.md) |

Examples: QuerySet optimisation → django-orm; designing an external API client → django-integrations,
but transforming its large datasets → here; Celery broker setup → django-integrations, but
designing a reliable chunked import task → here; file-processing security specifics → here,
with general principles in django-security-engineering.

Common pairings: CSV import → import/export + file-processing + validation (with django-security-engineering
file-upload-security); nightly ERP sync → ingestion + transformation + reconciliation (with
django-integrations data-synchronization-and-reconciliation); OOM in worker → large-dataset +
performance (with django-performance memory-and-resource-management).

## Architecture decision guidelines

| Decision | Prefer | Escalate when | Because |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where processing runs | In-request only for small, bounded, fast work (< ~1–2 s, few thousand rows) | Larger/slower → management command (ops-run) or Celery task (user-triggered) | Requests have timeouts and hold workers |
| Scheduler | Platform cron + management command, or Celery beat if Celery exists | Dependencies/backfills/SLAs across many jobs → orchestrator (Airflow/Dagster) | Orchestrators are infrastructure to run |
| Batch vs stream | Batch (scheduled or triggered) | Business needs sub-minute freshness → micro-batch, then streaming | Streaming adds ordering, state and ops cost |
| ETL vs ELT | ETL in Python for business-rule-heavy, row-level mapping | Set-based transforms on large data already in PostgreSQL → ELT (staging + SQL) | Move logic to where data and expertise are |
| Tooling | stdlib `csv`/generators + ORM | Analytical/columnar work → Polars/PyArrow (pandas if already used) | Dependencies and memory cost |
| Error policy | Isolate invalid records with a report; fail on structural errors or error rate > threshold | Regulated/financial all-or-nothing → validate fully, then load atomically | Users fix rows, not files; finance needs completeness |
| Transaction size | Committed batches (500–5 000 rows) + idempotent re-run | Small dataset with strict atomicity → one transaction or staging + set-based swap | Long transactions lock, bloat and are hard to retry |
| Loading | `bulk_create(update_conflicts=…)` per batch | Millions of rows → staging table via COPY + `INSERT … SELECT`/`MERGE` | Fewer round trips, set-based integrity |
| Parallelism | One worker, measure first | Proven CPU-bound → processes; I/O-bound → threads/async with bounded concurrency | Parallelism moves the bottleneck to the DB |
| Delivery guarantee | At-least-once + idempotent sink | — exactly-once is never assumed from Celery or brokers | Redelivery always happens eventually |
| Correctness proof | Control totals and counts per run | Financial/regulated → field-level/hash reconciliation with exception workflow | Successful execution can still lose data |

Record hard-to-reverse choices (orchestrator, staging model, error policy, retention) in an ADR.

## Production validation checklist

- [ ] Volume, frequency, latency and correctness requirements are written down; architecture is the simplest that meets them.
- [ ] Inputs bounded (size, rows, entries, pages, runtime); type sniffed from bytes; parsers are XXE/zip-bomb safe.
- [ ] Data contract defined; validation produces coded, located errors; dataset-vs-record rejection policy explicit.
- [ ] No whole-file or whole-table loads into memory; streaming/chunked I/O with measured batch sizes.
- [ ] Mapping definitions versioned; version and source recorded on outputs (lineage).
- [ ] Loads are idempotent (natural keys/upserts/run ids); intra-batch duplicates removed; FKs resolved per batch.
- [ ] Transaction boundaries justified; bulk operations account for skipped `save()`, signals and `full_clean()`.
- [ ] Tasks take ids, enqueue on commit, are idempotent, time-limited, retry only transient errors, and checkpoint long work.
- [ ] Job status, counters and error reports visible to users; stuck/cancelled jobs handled.
- [ ] Reconciliation (counts, totals, keys) runs after load; exceptions are tracked to resolution.
- [ ] Tenant scoping in every query, task, storage path and download; downloads are signed/short-lived and permission-checked.
- [ ] Sensitive data masked in logs and error reports; uploads, staging and reports purged per retention policy.
- [ ] Metrics, structured logs with correlation ids, and alerts for failures, rejection spikes, lag and queue age.
- [ ] Tests cover malformed files, boundaries, duplicates, partial failure, retry/idempotency and reconciliation.
- [ ] Third-party packages labelled and present in the lock file; `VERIFY:` items checked or disclosed.
