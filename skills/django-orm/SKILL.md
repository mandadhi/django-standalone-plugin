# Django ORM Engineering Specialist

Engineering judgement for Django's data layer: model the data so the database protects it, write
queries whose SQL you can predict, keep transactions short and explicit, evolve the schema without
downtime, and optimise only what measurement shows is slow. Baseline: **Django 5.2 LTS**;
version-specific APIs are qualified "(Django ≥ X.Y)" in the references. Check the project's
version (`python -m django --version` or the lock file) and its database backend before
recommending a version- or backend-specific feature.

## Activate when

- Adding or changing models, fields, relationships, constraints or indexes.
- Writing queries beyond simple `filter()` — expressions, subqueries, aggregation, window functions.
- Investigating N+1 queries, slow queries, wrong counts/sums, or unexpected query volume.
- Deciding transaction boundaries, row locking, idempotency or concurrency control.
- Authoring, reviewing, squashing or deploying migrations, especially on large tables.
- Considering raw SQL, a custom manager/QuerySet, or bulk inserts/updates.

## Engineering philosophy

1. **The ORM is the default data-access layer.** No repository layer over it without a real seam.
2. **Raw SQL is a justified exception**, chosen when the ORM cannot express the query well or a
   measured gain exists — always parameterised.
3. **Know when SQL runs.** QuerySets are lazy; evaluation, caching and cloning are predictable.
4. **The database enforces integrity.** Constraints, `NOT NULL`, FKs and unique indexes — not only
   Python validation.
5. **Concurrency is designed, not hoped for.** Atomic updates, locks or version checks for every
   read-modify-write; transactions are short and owned by the use case.
6. **Measure before optimising.** Query count, query time, rows and plans — fewer queries is not
   automatically faster.
7. **Abstractions earn their place.** A custom manager/QuerySet only for reused, named query
   vocabulary or default scoping that must not be forgotten.
8. **Readable over clever.** A slightly longer query a reviewer understands beats a dense one.
9. **Migrations are production code.** Reviewed, reversible where possible, safe for the code
   version that is running while they apply.

## ORM engineering workflow

1. **Frame the task** — read/write path, data volume, concurrency, consistency requirement,
   Django version and backend.
2. **Load the matching references** from the table below — usually one to three, never all.
3. **Inspect only the affected models, QuerySets, services/selectors and migrations.**
4. **Design from the data outwards**: model and constraints → query shape (predict the SQL) →
   transaction and locking → migration plan.
5. **Implement** with the canonical patterns in the references; keep transactions in the service
   that owns the use case.
6. **Measure and validate** — query count/time in tests, `QuerySet.explain()` for hot queries,
   `makemigrations --check`, `sqlmigrate` for risky migrations.
7. **Explain** the trade-offs, backend assumptions and anything marked `VERIFY`.

## Validation checklist

- [ ] Invariants that must always hold are database constraints, each with a stable `name`.
- [ ] Every read-modify-write is an atomic update, a locked read, or a version-checked write.
- [ ] Transactions are explicit, short, contain no network I/O; side effects use `on_commit`.
- [ ] Hot paths have a known query count (asserted in tests) and no N+1.
- [ ] New filters/orderings on large tables are backed by an index verified with `explain()`.
- [ ] Aggregations over multiple relations were checked for join fan-out.
- [ ] Raw SQL is justified, parameterised, and identifiers come from an allow-list.
- [ ] Bulk operations account for skipped `save()`, signals and validation.
- [ ] `makemigrations --check --dry-run` is clean; risky migrations reviewed with `sqlmigrate`
      and are safe for the currently deployed code.
- [ ] Version- and backend-specific features match the project's Django version and database.
- Docs: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/> (match the URL version to the project's).
