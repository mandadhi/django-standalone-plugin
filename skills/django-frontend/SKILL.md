# Django Frontend Engineering Specialist

Engineering judgement for the browser-facing side of Django: which frontend architecture to
choose, how to compose templates into reusable UI, when JavaScript earns its place, and how to
verify accessibility, security and performance where users actually experience them.

Baseline: **Django 5.2 LTS · Python 3.12+ · HTML Living Standard · modern CSS · ES2022+ ·
HTMX 2.x · Alpine.js 3.x · Tailwind CSS 4.x · React 19.x · Vite**. Version-specific behaviour is
qualified ("Django ≥ 5.1", "Tailwind v4", "HTMX 2.x"); uncertain claims carry `[VERIFY: …]`.
Check the project's `requirements`/lock file and `package-lock.json` before recommending a
version-specific API. Third-party packages (django-htmx, django-template-partials, django-vite,
WhiteNoise, django-cors-headers, django-csp, …) are named as such — never assume installed.

## Activate when

- Choosing or reviewing a frontend architecture for a Django project.
- Writing or refactoring templates, layouts, components, partials or custom template tags.
- Building forms UX, client-side validation, dynamic fields, uploads or multi-step flows.
- Adding interactivity with HTMX, Alpine.js or vanilla JavaScript.
- Styling with CSS, Tailwind or Bootstrap; establishing design tokens or a design system.
- Integrating a React (or other SPA) frontend with Django/DRF: auth, CSRF, CORS, builds.
- Configuring static files, Vite/Tailwind builds, WhiteNoise/CDN delivery.
- Fixing accessibility, Core Web Vitals, XSS/CSP or browser-compatibility issues.
- Writing template, HTMX, JavaScript, component, browser, a11y or visual tests.

## Frontend engineering principles

1. **Simplest architecture that satisfies the requirements.** Server-rendered templates first;
   add HTMX for server interactions, Alpine for local UI state, React only where rich
   client-side state justifies a build pipeline and an API. Never default to an SPA.
2. **Progressive enhancement.** Semantic HTML that works (links navigate, forms submit) before
   any JavaScript; enhancements degrade to that baseline.
3. **The server is the authority.** Validation, permissions and business rules live in Django.
   Client validation is UX; hidden or disabled UI is not a security control.
4. **Native HTML before ARIA, CSS before JavaScript.** `<button>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`,
   form validation attributes and CSS states first; ARIA only to fill genuine semantic gaps.
5. **Templates present, they don't compute.** Views/selectors prepare data; templates compose
   reusable components. Auto-escaping stays on; data reaches JS via `json_script`.
6. **Every interaction has loading, empty, error and success states** — and they are announced
   to assistive technology.
7. **Measure before optimising.** Field Core Web Vitals and DevTools traces decide what to fix.
8. **Assets are built, fingerprinted and collected** at deploy time; development serving is
   never production delivery.

## Frontend engineering workflow

1. **Understand** product requirements, users, devices and critical workflows.
2. **Identify** rendering and interaction needs: SEO, interactivity depth, offline, real-time.
3. **Choose** server-rendered, HTMX, hybrid (islands) or SPA → *Architecture selection* below.
4. **Define** the template/component structure and directory layout.
5. **Establish** design tokens and responsive layout rules.
6. **Implement** semantic HTML and accessible interactions.
7. **Add JavaScript only where necessary** (HTMX/Alpine/vanilla/React, in that order of weight).
8. **Integrate** Django forms and backend communication (fragments or API).
9. **Configure** static assets and build tooling.
10. **Implement** loading, empty and error states.
11. **Test** accessibility, responsiveness and browser behaviour.
12. **Optimise** performance from measurements.
13. **Validate** production asset delivery and security headers.

Load one to three references per step — never all.

## Architecture selection

| Requirement profile | Choose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| CRUD, content, forms, reports; SEO; small team | Server-rendered templates | [production-frontend-architectures.md](references/production-frontend-architectures.md) |
| Above + live search, inline edit, partial updates, modals | Templates + HTMX | [htmx-engineering.md](references/htmx-engineering.md) |
| Above + local widgets (tabs, dropdowns, toggles, client-only filters) | + Alpine.js | [alpine-js-engineering.md](references/alpine-js-engineering.md) |
| Mostly server-rendered, a few rich widgets (editor, chart builder, kanban) | Hybrid: templates + React islands | [django-react-integration.md](references/django-react-integration.md) |
| App-like UX, heavy client state, offline, multiple clients sharing an API, separate FE team | DRF API + React SPA | [django-react-integration.md](references/django-react-integration.md) |

Escalate only when a concrete requirement fails at the current level; record the decision in an
ADR ([django-architecture](../django-architecture/SKILL.md)). Full criteria:
[frontend-engineering-fundamentals.md](references/frontend-engineering-fundamentals.md).

## Skill pairings and handoffs

| Topic | Skill |
|---|---|
| Template engine/loader lifecycle, views, URLs, Form/ModelForm mechanics, static file fundamentals, sessions | [django-core](../django-core/SKILL.md) |
| App boundaries, service/selector layers, ADRs | [django-architecture](../django-architecture/SKILL.md) |
| API endpoints, serializers, DRF auth/permissions, pagination and error formats | [django-rest-framework](../django-rest-framework/SKILL.md) |
| Backend enforcement: CSRF/CORS/CSP settings, authz, sessions, XSS sanitisation, uploads | [django-security-engineering](../django-security-engineering/SKILL.md) |
| TTFB, queries, caching, HTTP/static delivery at the server | [django-performance](../django-performance/SKILL.md) |
| Test architecture, Django test client, pytest-django, CI | [django-testing](../django-testing/SKILL.md) |

Rule of thumb: this skill decides **what the browser receives and how users interact with it**;
the paired skill owns **the server-side mechanism and its enforcement**.

## Architecture decision guidelines

| Decision | Prefer | Because |
|---|---|---|
| Rendering model | Server-rendered HTML | SEO, fast first paint, one source of truth, no API duplication |
| Partial updates | HTMX returning template fragments from the same view | Reuses templates, forms and permissions; no client state to sync |
| Local UI behaviour | Native HTML → CSS → Alpine → vanilla module | Least code, least to break |
| Rich client app | React islands before a full SPA | Keeps Django auth, routing, forms and SEO for the rest |
| Browser auth for own frontend | Session cookie + CSRF, same-site | HttpOnly, revocable; no tokens in JS-readable storage |
| Styling | Project tokens as CSS custom properties; Tailwind or Bootstrap only if the team benefits | Frameworks add build and conventions cost |
| Components | Django includes/inclusion tags (partials where available) | One markup source for pages and fragments |
| Data to JS | `json_script` / `data-*` attributes | No inline-script XSS, works with CSP |
| Build tooling | None → Tailwind standalone CLI → Vite | Add a Node toolchain only when bundling is needed |
| Validation | Django forms/serializers authoritative; HTML5 attributes for UX | Client checks are bypassable |
| State | URL → server → local component; global store last | Shareable, back-button-safe, fewer sync bugs |

## Production validation checklist

- [ ] Architecture choice is documented and the simplest that meets requirements.
- [ ] Core pages and forms work without JavaScript, or the exception is justified.
- [ ] Semantic landmarks, one `<h1>`, logical headings, labelled controls, visible focus.
- [ ] Keyboard-only pass on critical flows; dialogs trap and restore focus; swaps announce changes.
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA automated checks (axe) pass; contrast and target sizes verified.
- [ ] No `|safe`/`mark_safe` on user data; no `innerHTML` with untrusted data; JSON via `json_script`.
- [ ] CSRF on every unsafe request (forms, HTMX, fetch, SPA); CORS is an explicit allow-list.
- [ ] CSP deployed (report-only first) and compatible with HTMX/Alpine/inline scripts in use.
- [ ] No secrets in templates, bundles, `VITE_*` vars or public source maps.
- [ ] Every HTMX/API endpoint enforces auth and permissions server-side; hidden UI is not relied upon.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error and success states exist for each async interaction.
- [ ] `collectstatic` runs with manifest storage in the build; hashed assets cached `immutable`; HTML not.
- [ ] `npm ci` from a committed lockfile; dependencies audited; third-party scripts reviewed (SRI where static).
- [ ] Field Core Web Vitals within budget (LCP ≤ 2.5 s, INP ≤ 200 ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 at p75).
- [ ] Template/HTMX tests, JS/component tests and a few Playwright journeys run in CI on target browsers.
- [ ] Claims marked `[VERIFY: …]` were checked against the installed versions or disclosed.
